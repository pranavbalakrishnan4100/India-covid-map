# India Covid Map

An interactive website that displays the current day corona virus statistics such as new cases,recoveries,deaths and vaccination data of states across India. 

The entire project was built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.Leaflet.js- a javascript library for interactive maps was used to display the statistics on the map of India.
The statitstics themselves were obtained from covid19india.org 's API. I also made use of OpenCage's GeoCoding API for Reverse and Forward geocoding,thereby making the web application more interactive. 

The user can select a particular state by clicking on it on the map or by typing it into the input box. The website is responsive and is built to make sure the user sees a clean UI irrespective of the device screen size.

The website has been deployed using GitHub pages. [View here.](https://pranavbalakrishnan4100.github.io/India-covid-map/)
